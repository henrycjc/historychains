				<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>History Chains is a project developed by 5 undergraduate students at the University of Queensland. A source and referenced based 
					social media of sorts, we have captured the essence of user interaction through relentless research and planning. So how will this 
					benefit you? Great Question! This referencing app is targeted towards younger students, namely that of 14-18 studying Modern Australian
					History and other related subjects. The user will be able to search through Trove's extensive collections of artifacts, articles and mostly 
					any electronic media you can think of. You will be able to keep track of your chains and post comments on reliability of sources, helping 
					you through your research stage of your assignments.</p>
