##About
History Chains is an academic research based social network of sorts, developed by three undergraduate students at The University of Queensland. It is targeted towards younger students, 14 to 18 years old studying Modern Australian History and other related subjects. History Chains makes extensive use of the Trove API, an intiative by the National Library of Australia to catalogue Australia's history digitally. 

The user can search through Trove's extensive library of articles, books and a number of other electronic mediums and add them to their "Chain" a collection of sources for their topic.

History Chains requires a L*MP stack (we used nginx). 

It is fairly lightweight and should work with versions of PHP 5+.
